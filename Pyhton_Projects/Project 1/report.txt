3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Day of the Week)
      Approach: I simply copied down the equations in the format of python

      Issues and resolution: The only issue that happened was that during
      testing I did not write my peranthesis correctily. This gave me the
      wrong values when I tested for it. I resolved the issue by simply,
      testing each out. So I tested what was y0 and so on
      till I found which line I did wrong.

   Problem 2 (Mercator Projection)
      Approach: For the mercator I wrote the formula down
      in pycharm and used math.sin and math.log.
      Issues and resolution: The issue was that I couldn't do the output
      because floats can be used with +. So I had to
      convert them to strings to make it work. I also forgot
      to use math.radians to convert it, which i later found
      out via testing, and went over the directions to see
      that I needed to use it.

   Problem 3 (Great Circle Distance)
      Approach: The approach was to write down the formula
      for d in pycharm and set the the agruments as well.

      Issues and resolution: The only issue was that I again
       forgot to convert it to radians. This issue was resolved
      after revisitng the directions

   Problem 4 (Wind Chill)
      Approach: For wind chill I did what I usaully do for these types
      of problems is copy and write down the formula


      Issues and resolution: No Issues

   Problem 5 (Gravitational Force)
      Approach: Copied formula for both G and f and used
      scietific notation for G

      Issues and resolution: No issues

   Problem 6 (Snell's Law)
      Approach: used math.sin for sin and theta instead of Î¸ as its
      easier to understand for me. Then wrote formula

      Issues and resolution: I had a problem with math.radians()
      and math.degrees and not knowing where to put them.
      This was figured out when I did a bunch of experiments till
      I got the disired output. Such as placing them where I thought
      they belonged


   Problem 7 (Gambler's Ruin)
      Approach: Copy formula and and all the other variables such as q
      and defined p1 and p2.

      Issues and resolution: Issue that I had was I used n2 instead of n1 for p2
      variable. This issue was resolved when I retyped p2 and noticted midway through
      that I didn't do it correctly

   Problem 8 (Waiting Time)
      Approach: Defined p and worte its formula, then wrote its args.

      Issues and resolution: No issues

   Problem 9 (Die Roll)
      Approach: tried to figure out how to use strandom which
      I used to define the two variables that I created.

      Issues and resolution: I didn't know that for strandom.uniformInt()
      need an input of (n, n + 1). This I only figured out after googling how
      to use it.

   Problem 10 (Three Sort)
      Approach: I needed to create my own formuela and define the vairables.
      This I figured out the a way to create a varibale for the min
      and max. Then I created a fromula to figure out the middle number.
      Used str() to put into strings the 3 varibles,
      so that i could create a space using + between them.


      Issues and resolution: No Issues

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

    What I learned is that I need to pay attention more to small mistakes
    most of the issues is that i simply didn't pay attention enough.
    I also need to do more research on how and when to use radians
    and degrees. But other than that It was pretty easy.
