3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Particle Representation)
      Approach: My approach first of was to call the self method for
      _x and set it to zero. Then I dd the Add definition in which made it add one pixel to
      (x,y). Then i did mass which just returns self._pixels back, indicating number
      of pixels. The distanceTo was based of the euclidean distance formula in previous
      problems and then returned the sqrt distance. Then I finally did the string represent of b using,

      Issues and resolution: To be honest this was the easier one of the problems of
      the porject and didn't have major problems.

   Problem 2 (Particle Identification)
      Approach: The approach of doing this project was doing what I can from directions
      For instance what the different variables should I simply did them. There were
      some variables that i didn't do, because I didn't know how they will work together
      Thus I had for a brief time to ignore the variables and do what i need before coming back.
      i soo reached point that I filled in 50% of the problem, and then was able to understand the
      interaction between blob and blob finder.

      Issues and resolution: i ran into the problem of me not knowing how this problem work,
      until at least half of it was done. This added extra time to the project as a whole since
      it took me to sessions to do. That is the only problem was that this problem caused a lot more time
      to do.

   Problem 3 (Particle Tracking)
      Approach: My approach to this problem was pretty simple in that  defined the variables
      that were needed but I added one more called files. Files gives me a list of the images
      that need to be checked, for I didn't understand how else for me to do, since blobfinder
      directly relates to file and from that list we get beads1. Then I made a for loop
      that goes through each of the images and gives me beads 1 and saves the previous
      resulted to bead0. Then a second for loop which calculates how much each one moves from each
      other via the DIST variable. Then if dist if less than delta writes it out


      Issues and resolution: The main issue that I had with this was that I
      got beads0 and beads1 confused. I switched beads1 with beads0 on line 27 and beads1 and beads on lne 24.
      But, other than taking a very long time it wasn't very as you just had figured how
      the pieces with blobfinder would work together.

   Problem 4 (Data Analysis)
      Approach: The approach was very simple as the directions were very straight forward on
      what needed to be done.  Defined ETA, RHO, T and R and after that  simple wrote the
      formulas that needed to be done as was instructed. This was the easiest of all the problems
      on the project.

      Issues and resolution: I had no problems.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.
    The project was pretty simple in the fact that most were just follow the instructions and you are
    done, but problem 1,23,3 were the hardest and took me 4 hours of on and off time to do. The reason being that
    I had to read and reread what I am suppose to do for it. Other than that was a pretty fun project.
