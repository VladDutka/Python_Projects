3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (RSA Library)
      Approach: The approach i took was to try to figure out how each of the functions
      would work to together. So, I started out by doing all the other functions first.
      It was pretty simple to implement all of them first as the instructions provided the framework of what I needed to do. I also tried various methods to find out how to 'shuffle'
      the first k elements and also how to create a copy of a list.

      Issues and resolution: In order for me to figure out how to shuffle the list
      I thought about that it had to do something with randomizing, and so I tried
      to use Std.random() from 0 to the length of the list that was the copy. I also
      Looked up how to make a copy of a list, and it turned out pretty simple it was
      .copy(). There were some minor other problems, but it was pretty simple to do.

   Problem 2 (Keygen Program)
      Approach: The approach I took was pretty simple in that I simply
      did the lo and hi as accepted ints, then I made key equal
      to the tuples that keygen would return. I then split it up using indexes
      from key[0] - key[2] to get each value in the indexes, and then I made them
      into a string, and it simply outputted the values separated by a space.
      Issues and resolution: I had no problems with problem.

   Problem 3 (Encryption Program)
      Approach: The approach I had with this was to just follow the instructions.
      I made the width equal to the width of the encryption and figured out how make
      it read the "message" that was being inputted. I then wrote the for loop, and
      used the _dec2bin to convert the decimal number that was made by ord() and
      converted to binary, then outputted.

      Issues and resolution: The problem I had was trying to figure how to do
      how to read the message. I went through the notes to figure out that I could
      do readall(). I then remembered that I can use dec2bin from the RSA to convert the
      number to binary.

   Problem 4 (Decryption Program)
      Approach: With the decryption program I simply copied everything from the encryption
      program till the for loop. I then followed the for loop. Rather than using l and
      defining it, I simply used len(message) instead with the -1 because I would already
      subtract it from if used in the for loop range argument. The rest was pretty simple
      to implement, as it was described in the instructions.

      Issues and resolution: The problem I ran into was figuring out was the substring.
      I resolved it by simply reading an article about it from W3 schools, and thus it became
      pretty simple to do after it.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.
    To be honest this project was easier than the previous one impart because we
    did the other one and simply introduced and implemented them with functions. Thus,
    overall this was one of the asier projects.
