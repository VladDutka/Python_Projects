3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Generating the Waltz)
      Approach: The approach I took with generating the waltz was that
      of creating definitions. The reason I took this approach was
      if the player wanted to change the scope they could easily do
      it. The second reason was that if I needed to integrate with
      play waltz file later on. The Definition functions also
      allowed the tri and measures to be separated allowing it to look
      and operate better. If any part of trio or measure needed to be changed
      it would allow it for it in a more efficient manner. Other than that
      I simply followed the instructions, and it worked.

      Issues and resolution: The only real problem was with the fact
      that I couldn't get read int to work but first tried it with .open
      method. This was very timing consuming, and I needed to debug the
      whole code to make it work. But, then as I was going through
      the other problems I needed to see the inputs and realized
      I could do it with read all ints.

   Problem 2 (Playing the Waltz)
      Approach: The approach that I took with play waltz
      was similar to what I took with generate waltz in that
      I made a main function, because I was told it is good
      practice to keep code organized. Then rest was just following
      instructions, the If stamens were easy and the .play was
      pretty self-explanatory. But other than that it was just
      following the instructions

      Issues and resolution: The only issue I had was that numpy was not
      working correctly. This took some time and me talking to someone
      as to why numpy was broken. It would seem it was corrupted, and I
      needed to reinstall it. But, other than that everything worked pretty
      well.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I feel like the project was fairly easy, except that the instructions
   were confusing and that they were the hardest part. Like I could
   get the output, but then it would be done the way it was meant to.
   But, once I reread it multiple times it all made sense.
