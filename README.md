 ## Project 1
 1. Day of the Week:

    Description: A program (day_of_week.py) that determines the day of the week based on a given date. It accepts the month, day, and year as command-line arguments and outputs the day (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.).

2. Mercator Projection:

    Description: A program that implements the Mercator projection to map latitude and longitude (in degrees) into rectangular coordinates (x, y). It's a widely used projection in nautical charts and online maps.

3. Great Circle Distance:

    Description: A program (great_circle.py) that calculates the great-circle distance between two points on Earth using their latitude and longitude in degrees. The distance formula provided is used to compute the distance in kilometers.

4. Wind Chill:

    Description: A program that calculates the effective temperature (or wind chill) based on given temperature (in Fahrenheit) and wind speed (in miles per hour), according to the National Weather Service's formula.

5. Gravitational Force:

    Description: A program (gravitational_force.py) that computes the gravitational force between two objects based on their masses and the distance between their centers. The program uses Newton's law of universal gravitation.

6. Snell‚Äôs Law:

    Description: An understanding of Snell's law which relates the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction to the reciprocal of the ratio of the indices of refraction of two mediums.

7. Gambler‚Äôs Ruin:

    Description: A probability-based problem involving a coin-flipping game between two players. It calculates the probabilities of each player going penniless based on their initial pennies and the probabilities of winning each toss.

8. Die Roll:

    Description: A program (die_roll.py) that simulates the rolling of an n-sided die twice and outputs the sum of the numbers rolled.

9. Three Sort:

    Description: A program (three_sort.py) that sorts and outputs three integer inputs in ascending order. The solution employs the use of min(), max(), and basic arithmetic operations to determine the order
 
 ## Project 2
 1. Wind Chill:

    Description: A program (wind_chill.py) that computes the effective temperature (or wind chill) based on a provided temperature (in Fahrenheit) and wind speed (in miles per hour) using the National Weather Service's formula. The program also checks and warns the user if the temperature is over 50¬∞F or if the wind speed is 3 mph or less.

3. Playing Card:

    Description: A program (card.py) that randomly selects and displays a card from a standard 52-card deck.

4. Root Finding:

    Description: A program (root.py) that computes the kth root of a number 'c', up to a specified decimal place (epsilon). This is an enhancement of the sqrt.py program discussed in class.

5. Greatest Common Divisor:

    Description: A program (gcd.py) that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two provided integers, p and q.

7. Sum of Powers:

    Description: A program (sum_of_powers.py) that computes the sum of powers of numbers, where the sum goes from 1 to n, and each term is raised to the power of k.

8. Dragon Curve:

    Description: A program (dragon_curve.py) that provides instructions for drawing a dragon curve of order 'n'. The instructions are composed of characters F, L, and R, representing drawing actions and direction changes.

9. Perfect Numbers:

    Description: A program (perfect_numbers.py) that identifies and displays perfect numbers less than or equal to a given integer 'n'. A perfect number is one where its divisors (excluding itself) sum up to the number.

10. Ramanujan Numbers:

    Description: A program (ramanujan_numbers.py) inspired by the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan that identifies numbers less than or equal to 'n' that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two distinct ways.
 
 ## Project 3
 Problem 1 (Generating the Waltz) - Description:
Create a program named generatewaltz.py. This program will read the minuet and trio tables from the input. Based on these tables, it will randomly select measures to create a 32-measure sequence. The resulting sequence is then printed out.

Problem 2 (Playing the Waltz) - Description:
Develop a program named playwaltz.py. This program will take a sequence of 32 integers (representing the waltz measures) from the input. Before playing, it checks for:

    Correct sequence length (must be 32 measures).
    Valid range for minuet measures (between 1 and 176).
    Valid range for trio measures (between 1 and 96).

If any of these checks fail, the program exits and displays an appropriate error message. Otherwise, it plays the waltz measures as audio.
 
 ## Project 4
 The project involved creating an implementation of the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) public-key cryptosystem, a prevalent security mechanism in many technologies, including web browsers, ATMs, and mobile gadgets. Central to the RSA algorithm is the handling of massive integers, adeptly managed using Python's int data type in this endeavor. The goal was to craft a robust library catering to the essential operations fundamental to the RSA cryptosystem, alongside developing programs proficient in encrypting and decrypting messages using this system.

 ## Project 5
 In this endeavor, our mission was to emulate Perrin's seminal experiment, leveraging cutting-edge video and computing technologies to precisely gauge and chart the Brownian motion of microscopic particles. Armed with video microscopy data depicting polystyrene spheres in aqueous suspension, our responsibility pivoted to deploying our coding expertise. This involved dissecting the data, pinpointing the trajectory of each sphere between consecutive observations, aligning our findings with Einstein's theoretical model, and culminating in the computation of Avogadro's constant.
 
 ## Project 6 
 n this innovative venture, we delved deep into the realm of statistical modeling by harnessing the power of a Markov chain. Our primary objective was to capture the inherent patterns and structures typical to the English language. By feeding vast amounts of text into our model, we were able to discern and record the likelihood of a particular word or letter following another.

The heart of this project was the construction of a transition matrix, which captured the probabilities of transitioning from one state (or word) to another. This matrix became the foundation upon which we built our text generation algorithm.
